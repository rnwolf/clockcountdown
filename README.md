# Countdown Clock

A useful facilitator tool to create a highly visible countdown clock for timeboxing workshop activities. 

This python script should work on most computers with a recent (tested on 3.8 & 3.9) version of python installed.

## Install

Install a recent version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and optionally [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) version control.

Clone, with git, or dlownload a [zip](https://github.com/rnwolf/clockcountdown/releases) folder with repository files from github and extract to local working directory.

## To Run

Open the local working directory in your terminal command shell. MS-Windows users see this link to open shell [https://www.digitalcitizen.life/open-cmd](https://www.digitalcitizen.life/open-cmd).

In the shell run:
``` python
python clockcountdown.py 5
```
Will launch python and run the script. Countdown will proceed for 5 minutes.

Minimise the countdown app window to pause the clock.
